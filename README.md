This is the github with the codes for the Collective Interactions of a Human Trafficking Network in Mexico and the Limits of Dismantling Strategies paper.

Human tracking is a heartless crime that represents the second most profitable crime in the world. Mexico’s geographical position makes it a country with high levels of human tracking. Using the snowball sampling method, the major contribution of this paper is the abstraction of the criminal interactions of a human tracking network on the southern border of Mexico. Based on a social network analysis, it is identified that the criminal network is moderately centralized (44.32%) and with medium density (0.401). Therefore, the network has minimal cohesiveness and members may find it dicult to share information, money, or products among themselves. To evaluate di↵erent dismantling strategies to tackle the criminal organization, three algorithms are evaluated. We found that the first actors to be removed are neither the most connected nor the most peripheral, but the actors who are moderately connected to others of their kind should be removed. In summary, this paper provides a significant step forward to understand quantitatively the interactions of criminals and their roles in a real human tracking network and the limitations of dismantling strategies.

In the txt file one will find the nodes and edges that fully describe the network of 34 operator nodes.

The python file has the necessary algorithms in functions to find the optimal isolation strategy describen in the paper.
